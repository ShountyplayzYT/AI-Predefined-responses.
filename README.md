This project was made my shaurya shah, and dives into how json files can be used to create a set reponseed way of an AI

The way this project works:
    A json file is created with all the predefine responses.
    A code is written such to read and write reponses from the AI

  A text to speech and visaverca technology is also used to say what the AI replies, AND if you want to talk to the AI, then you have to say what you want to speak.
